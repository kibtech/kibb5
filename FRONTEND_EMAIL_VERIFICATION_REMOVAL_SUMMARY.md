## 🚀 User Experience Changes

### **Before (With Email Verification):**
1. User registers → "Check your email for verification" → Redirect to verification page
2. User enters OTP → Email verified → Can now login
3. Password reset → "Check your email for code" → Enter OTP → Reset password

### **After (No Email Verification):**
1. User registers → "Registration successful! You can now login" → Redirect to login
2. User can login immediately after registration
3. Password reset → Enter new password directly → Password reset successful

- Make sure to run the backend migration scripts first
- Restart your Flask application after backend changes

### **Build Required:**
